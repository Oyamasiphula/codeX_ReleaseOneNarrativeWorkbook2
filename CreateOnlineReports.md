#Create online reports

## Background

Now let's display all the data you mined from the Nelissa's CSV File online. For that you will need a web server, a template engine and data. You already have the data, as a web server we will be using Express JS and as a template engine Handlebars JS. You will install all these depencies using ```npm```

There are loads of alternatives to all the above in the Node JS eco-system, but knowing how the selected toolset work will give you a good baseline to explore alternatives from. 

You should focus on:
* Express JS - http://expressjs.com/
* Handlebars JS - http://handlebarsjs.com/
* Handlebars JS & Express integration layer - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars

## Concepts

Some concepts you might bump into while doing this work.

* JSON
  * Javascript Object Notation
  * Data Interchange - alternative to XML
  * Use require statement to import data
* Templates
  * HTML & CSS
  * layout
  * http://handlebarsjs.com/
* Web Server
  * Express JS
    * Create routes
    * Combine data and template
    * Renders dynamic content using a view engine

## Get going with Express JS

Here are some basic instructions on how to get going with Express JS.

I takes you through the steps of:
* installing
* getting a basic instance to run
* setting up basic routes
* rendering static files

Once done with these steps:

http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html

http://expressjs.com/starter/hello-world.html

http://expressjs.com/starter/basic-routing.html

http://expressjs.com/starter/static-files.html

You should have a basic Express JS setup inplace which can be used as a baseline to get some basic reports up and running.

## Easy server restarts

One thing you will find is that you will need to restart Express JS everytine you changed a source file to get around that  install ```nodemon``` This will restart Express JS whenever a source file changes. 

Its here : https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon - install it using npm

Use it like this:

```nodemon server.js```


##Templating

We will be using ```handlebars``` as the template engine, it combines data with templates to render information.

A typical handlebars template look likes this

```
<div class="entry">
  {{#if author}}
    <h1>{{firstName}} {{lastName}}</h1>
  {{/if}}
</div>
```

Handlebars JS is built on top of Moustache templating engine and extends it. Moustache templating aims to be logicless templates, but that aim make it hard to use at times.

> See some background information on the difference between Handlebars and Moustache : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10555820/what-are-the-differences-between-mustache-js-and-handlebars-js

Handlebars comes with a set of built in helpers that makes it easy for one to process data and convert it into a layout. It support things like if statements and loops.
